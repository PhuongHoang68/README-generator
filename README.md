  ## Description: 
  READMEs are an important part of any projects, as it guides users through how the app works and its purpose. I have simplified the process of creating a ReadMe, by creating a command-line README generator. Users could input all the necessary information, and a customized README will be generated.

  ## Installation: 
  To use, you simply have to download my ZIP files, make sure you have Inquirer installed, and then type "node index.js". The prompts will guide you t thru how to use the ReadMe generator



  ## Usage: 
  You only need to follow the prompts, and your ReadMe will be generated



  ## Contribution: 
  No other contributors



  ## Tests: 
  This is a simple command-line application, so I didn't see a need for a test. But feel free to clone this to your local set-up and run any tests you would like
